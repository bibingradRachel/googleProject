Automatic sentence completion

The project target:
To display the input of the five most relevant completion from a given database (text files in a folder tree structure)

Implementation :

DATABASE --
Dictionary of sentences:
Each member is: a sentence, the name of the file from which it was taken, its line number in 

Dictionary of word:
Key - the word
Value - The indexes are from the Dictionary of the sentences in which the word appears

First stage:
Read the files into the database

Second stage:
The system waits for input from the user, the system ignores punctuation in the text
For each of the words in the text we will take the sentences in which it is according to the database
To support the possibility of spelling errors in the input or return sentences with similar input when the input is not found:
We have created a dictionary that contains as a key all the variations of the word - 
deleting each of the letters, replacing each of the letters with each of the letters abc.. , and inserting each of the abc.. letters between each of the two letters of the word.
Each of the variations of the word has a score according to the original
According to this we will return the 5 sentences with the highest score.

In order to support the possibility of giving priority to sentences in which appear in the sequence of words as the sequence entered by the user 
we did something that makes the search significantly longer so this is a point we would like to improve on our program.
(Just to note that without this feature the search takes a split second)






Running example:
